*Generative AI-Powered Mood-Based Audio Recommendations for Kuku FM*

MoodMingle is an AI feature prototype designed to personalize content on Kuku FM based on a user’s emotional state. By interpreting mood from user interactions, MoodMingle aims to increase daily listening time and app engagement through smarter recommendations.

---

## 💡 Why MoodMingle?

Traditional recommendation systems rely solely on past behavior. MoodMingle introduces emotional intelligence into the mix — giving users what they *feel like* listening to in that moment. It’s dynamic, empathetic, and user-first.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Emotion-Aware Suggestions**: Uses NLP to identify a user’s mood from their queries and interactions.
- **Generative Personalization**: Combines mood clusters + collaborative filtering for content generation.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously refines suggestions based on feedback and usage patterns.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **NLP**: Transformers (e.g., BERT/RoBERTa) for mood detection from queries
- **ML Clustering**: KMeans or DBSCAN for grouping emotional behavior
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Matrix factorization for personalization
- **Design**: Figma for UI prototyping
